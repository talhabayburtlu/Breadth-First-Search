# Breadth-First-Search
A project that uses breadth first search for finding minimum hops between laptops within Algorithm Analysis course.

## How It Works
Program reads input file from command line arguments then stores the laptop location and radius information. Input file format must be seperated with lines, and for each line there must be *"x y radius"* variables. The program uses breadth first search algorithm for finding required minimum hops from first laptop to every laptop. Minimum hops are displayed at *"output.txt"*
